## Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

1. Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, data destruction, and service interruption
2. Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission from the account holder
3. Do not exploit a vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the issue
4. Keep information about discovered vulnerabilities confidential until we have addressed the issue
5. Provide us a reasonable amount of time to address the vulnerability before public disclosure

**Legal Protection:**

When conducting security research according to this policy, we commit to:
- Not pursue or support legal action against you for security research conducted under this policy
- Work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly
- Recognize your contribution publicly (if desired and appropriate)

This policy is not an authorization to access systems in violation of law. However, if legal action is initiated by a third party against you for activities conducted under this policy, we will take steps to make it known that your actions were conducted in compliance with this policy.

**Acknowledgment Will Include:**
- Confirmation we received your report
- Assigned tracking number (e.g., VUL-2026-001)
- Expected timeline for initial assessment
- Point of contact for follow-up

### Validation & Triage

**Timeline:** Initial assessment within **5 business days**.

**We will:**
1. Validate the vulnerability
2. Assess severity and impact
3. Determine affected versions/components
4. Develop remediation plan

**You may be asked to:**
- Provide additional information
- Test our proposed fix
- Extend the disclosure timeline (if needed)

### Remediation

**Timeline:** Varies by severity
- Critical: 7 days
- High: 14 days
- Medium: 30 days
- Low: 60 days

**We will:**
1. Develop and test fix
2. Deploy fix to production
3. Verify fix effectiveness
4. Prepare disclosure statement

**We will keep you updated:**
- Weekly status updates (minimum)
- Notification when fix is deployed
- Invitation to verify fix
- Coordination on public disclosure

### Disclosure

**Coordinated Disclosure:**
- We prefer 90-day disclosure timeline after fix deployment
- Shorter or longer timelines can be negotiated
- We will work with you on disclosure content
- Credit will be given (unless you prefer anonymity)

**Public Acknowledgment:**
- Security advisory published on our website
- Credit given to researcher (if desired)
- CVE assigned (if applicable)

## Severity Assessment

We use CVSS 3.1 scoring to assess vulnerability severity:

**Critical (9.0-10.0):**
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Full database access
- Mass data exfiltration

**High (7.0-8.9):**
- Privilege escalation
- Significant data exposure
- Stored XSS on sensitive pages
- SQL injection with limited impact

**Medium (4.0-6.9):**
- Reflected XSS
- CSRF on important functions
- Information disclosure
- Authorization flaws

**Low (0.1-3.9):**
- Self-XSS
- CSRF on non-critical functions
- Minor information disclosure
- Security best practice violations

## Examples of Valid Vulnerabilities

### ✅ Good Reports

**Example 1: Stored XSS**
```
Stored XSS in activity description field allows any authenticated
user to execute arbitrary JavaScript in other users' browsers.

Steps:
1. Login as regular user
2. Create activity with description: <script>alert('XSS')</script>
3. Other users viewing activity see alert
4. Attacker could steal session cookies

Impact: Session hijacking, account takeover
Severity: High
```

**Example 2: Authorization Bypass**
```
Users can view other teams' private activities by manipulating
activity ID in API request.

Steps:
1. Login as user on Team A
2. Intercept GET /api/activities/123 request
3. Change ID to 456 (Team B's activity)
4. Response contains Team B's private data

Impact: Unauthorized data access
Severity: High
```

### ❌ Invalid Reports

**Example 1: Out of Scope**
```
Your login page is vulnerable to credential brute force.
I tested 10,000 password combinations on a test account.

Issue: DoS testing is out of scope
```

**Example 2: Not a Vulnerability**
```
Your site is missing the X-Frame-Options header.

Issue: No demonstrable impact; missing headers without
       exploit are out of scope
```

**Example 3: Known Issue**
```
Your site uses an old version of jQuery (3.6.0).

Issue: Software version disclosure without exploit is
       out of scope; also likely already known
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do you have a bug bounty program?**
A: Not yet, but it's planned for Q3 2025. Currently, we offer recognition and acknowledgment.

**Q: How long do I need to wait before public disclosure?**
A: We ask for 90 days after fix deployment, but this is negotiable.

**Q: Can I test on production?**
A: Only non-destructive testing on your own accounts. No DoS, no data modification.

**Q: What if I accidentally accessed user data?**
A: Stop immediately, document what happened, report it to us. Do not access, store, or share the data.

**Q: Can I run automated scanners?**
A: Yes, but with rate limiting to avoid service impact. Stay under 10 requests/second.

**Q: What if I find a vulnerability in a third-party service?**
A: Report it to the third-party directly. We appreciate a heads-up but cannot address third-party issues.

**Q: Will you sue me if I accidentally break something?**
A: No, as long as you were acting in good faith under this policy and report the issue.

**Q: Can I participate anonymously?**
A: Yes, we accept anonymous reports. Public acknowledgment is optional.

**Q: What if we disagree on severity?**
A: We'll discuss it with you. Our assessment is final, but we're open to dialogue.
